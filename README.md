# Custom Quotes Tab
This is a Chrome extension that allows you to add custom, self-defined quotes with author to a new tab.
Each time a new tab is opened, a random quote will be chosen from your collection.

## Installation
- Download this extension into a folder on your local filesystem
- Go to the [Chrome extension page](chrome://extensions/)
- Click the "Load Unpacked" button
- Select the folder where this extension is located
- Move on to the configuration section

## Configuration
- Go to the extension options page
- Enter your personal quotes in the textarea using the following guidelines:
  - Use the following format: ```This is a quote|author```
  - Only one quote per line. Long quotes can span multiple lines but don't use an enter in those cases.
  - If you don't define an author after a "pipe" character, "Unknown" will be shown
  - Empty lines will be filtered out and will not show up
